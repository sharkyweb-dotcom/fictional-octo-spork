        <p>
            Catan is a game in which settlers try to claim the most victory points by buiding settlements, roads, and cities. In the game, players
            are settlers trying to colonize an island full of resources named Catan. Players start with two settlements and two roads each. Players recieve different
            very different resources depending on where their settlements are at. This brings up the question of how to make a fair setup. The booklet
            that comes with the game only offers <em>one</em> setup. After playing with this setup many times, it can get boring. But this website offers
            new fair and exciting setups where everybody has a chance to win, no matter where they start!

        <h2 class='subtitle'>What we do to Make our Catan Maps Fair</h2>
        <p>We do many things to make our Catan Maps fair. Oe thing we do is making everybody's settlements the same distance away from each other.
        Another thing that we do to make our catan maps fair is make sure everybody has the same propability of getting resources. The dots on
        each number should add up to be the same number. We also make sure nobody's roads are blocked by the distance rule of other settlements.
